= Managed broker configurations

[role="_abstract"]
When you deploy Strimzi on Kubernetes, you can specify broker configuration through the `config` property of the `Kafka` custom resource.
However, certain broker configuration options are managed directly by Strimzi and cannot be set within this `config` property.

As such, you cannot configure the following options through the `config` property:

* `node.id` to specify the ID of the Kafka node
* `log.dirs` directories for log data
* `listeners` to expose the Kafka cluster to clients
* `authorization` mechanisms to allow or decline actions executed by users
* `authentication` mechanisms to prove the identity of users requiring access to Kafka

Node IDs start from 0 (zero) and run sequentially across the Kafka cluster.
Log directories are mounted to `/var/lib/kafka/data/kafka-log<pod_id>` based on the `spec.storage` configuration specified in the `KafkaNodePool` custom resource.
For JBOD storage, they are mounted at `/var/lib/kafka/data-<volume_id>/kafka-log<pod_id>`.

For a list of exclusions, see the link:{BookURLConfiguring}#type-KafkaClusterSpec-reference[`KafkaClusterSpec` schema reference].
