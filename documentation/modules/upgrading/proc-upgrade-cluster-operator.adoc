= Upgrading the Cluster Operator using installation files

[role="_abstract"]
This procedure describes how to upgrade a Cluster Operator deployment to use Strimzi {ProductVersion}.

Follow this procedure if you deployed the Cluster Operator using the installation YAML files in the `install/cluster-operator/` directory. 
The steps include the necessary configuration changes when the Cluster Operator watches multiple or all namespaces.

The availability of Kafka clusters managed by the Cluster Operator is not affected by the upgrade operation.

NOTE: Refer to the documentation supporting a specific version of Strimzi for information on how to upgrade to that version.

.Prerequisites

* An existing Cluster Operator deployment is available.
* You have xref:downloads-{context}[downloaded the release artifacts for Strimzi {ProductVersion}].
* You need an account with permission to create and manage `CustomResourceDefinition` and RBAC (`ClusterRole`, and `RoleBinding`) resources.

Currently, no feature gates require enabling or disabling before upgrading. 
If a feature gate introduces such a requirement, the details will be provided here.

.Procedure

. Take note of any configuration changes made during the previous Cluster Operator installation.
+
Any changes will be *overwritten* by the new version of the Cluster Operator.

. Update your custom resources to reflect the supported configuration options available for Strimzi version {ProductVersion}.

. Modify the installation files for the new Cluster Operator version to reflect the namespace in which the Cluster Operator is running.
+
include::../../shared/snip-cluster-operator-namespace-sed.adoc[]

. If you modified environment variables in the `Deployment` configuration, edit the
`060-Deployment-strimzi-cluster-operator.yaml` file to use those environment variables.
+
** If the Cluster Operator is watching multiple namespaces, add the list of namespaces to the `STRIMZI_NAMESPACE` environment variable.
** If the Cluster Operator is watching all namespaces, specify `value: "*"` for the `STRIMZI_NAMESPACE` environment variable.

. If the Cluster Operator is watching more than one namespace, update the role bindings.
+
** If watching multiple namespaces, replace the `namespace` in the `RoleBinding` installation files with the actual namespace name and create the role bindings for *each* namespace:
+
.Creating role bindings for a namespace
[source,shell]
----
kubectl create -f install/cluster-operator/020-RoleBinding-strimzi-cluster-operator.yaml -n <watched_namespace>
kubectl create -f install/cluster-operator/023-RoleBinding-strimzi-cluster-operator.yaml -n <watched_namespace>
kubectl create -f install/cluster-operator/031-RoleBinding-strimzi-cluster-operator-entity-operator-delegation.yaml -n <watched_namespace>
----
+
For example, if the Cluster Operator is watching three namespaces, create three sets of role bindings by substituting `<watched_namespace>` with the name of each namespace.
+
** If watching all namespaces, recreate the cluster role bindings that grant cluster-wide access (if needed):
+
.Granting cluster-wide access using role bindings
[source,shell]
----
kubectl create clusterrolebinding strimzi-cluster-operator-namespaced --clusterrole=strimzi-cluster-operator-namespaced --serviceaccount my-cluster-operator-namespace:strimzi-cluster-operator
kubectl create clusterrolebinding strimzi-cluster-operator-watched --clusterrole=strimzi-cluster-operator-watched --serviceaccount my-cluster-operator-namespace:strimzi-cluster-operator
kubectl create clusterrolebinding strimzi-cluster-operator-entity-operator-delegation --clusterrole=strimzi-entity-operator --serviceaccount my-cluster-operator-namespace:strimzi-cluster-operator
----

. When you have an updated configuration, deploy it along with the rest of the installation resources:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
kubectl replace -f install/cluster-operator
----
+
Wait for the rolling updates to complete.

. If the new operator version no longer supports the Kafka version you are upgrading from, an error message is returned.
+
To resolve this, upgrade to a supported Kafka version:
+
--
.. Edit the `Kafka` custom resource.
.. Change the `spec.kafka.version` property to a supported Kafka version.
--
+
If no error message is returned, you can proceed to the next step and upgrade the Kafka version later.

. Get the image for the Kafka pod to ensure the upgrade was successful:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
kubectl get pods my-cluster-kafka-0 -o jsonpath='{.spec.containers[0].image}'
----
+
The image tag shows the new Strimzi version followed by the Kafka version:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
{ExampleImageTagUpgrades}
----
+
You can also xref:con-upgrade-status-{context}[check the upgrade has completed successfully from the status of the `Kafka` resource].

The Cluster Operator is upgraded to version {ProductVersion}, but the version of Kafka running in the cluster it manages is unchanged.
